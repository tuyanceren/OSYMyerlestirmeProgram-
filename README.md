###OSYM Programe

This program calculates students’ scores by comparing their answer sheets with the answer key. It then ranks the students and places them in universities, taking into account their preferences and the universities’ quotas. In essence, this program bears a striking resemblance to the university placement program used by the Council of Higher Education.
